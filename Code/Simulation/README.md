### These are the codes used in performing the coarse-grained level and all-atom level simulations for protein co-translational and post-translational folding with the presence of small molecule ligands.

### 1. continuous_synthesis_v7.py
This is an updated version of the previous code [`continuous_synthesis_v6.py`](https://github.com/obrien-lab/cg_simtk_protein_folding/blob/master/Continuous_synthesis_protocol/continuous_synthesis_v6.py) for the co-translational protein folding simulation. 
In this version (v7), we incorporated the LJ 12-6 interactions between ligands and nascent chain. A spherical restraint was added on the ligand to avoid flying away. Details of the methodology can be found in the paper.
#### Parameters in Control file
The following parameters are new in this version. The description of other parameters can be found [here](https://github.com/obrien-lab/cg_simtk_protein_folding/wiki/continuous_synthesis_v6.py#3-parameters-in-control-file).
| Keywords | Type | Intepretation |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| start_traj_id | int | The trajectory index to start. This effects the output file names. |
| spherical_restraint_mask | string | Molecules to be restained within a shpere. For example, selection block "L24 : 42 - 59" will select all atoms in resid 42 to 59 of segid L24. Use ":" to select residue number and "@" to select atom name. Use " - " to select a range of residues (space required) and "," to select multiple individual residue. Use "\|" to separate multiple selection blocks. |
| spherical_restraint_center | float * 3 | x y z coordinate of the spherical center in angstrom for the restraint. |
| spherical_restraint_radius | float | Spherical radius in angstrom for the restraint. |

### 2. run_MD.py
This code is used for the post-translational protein folding simulation with ligand present on GPU. 
We incorporated the LJ 12-6 interactions between ligands and protein. A center-of-mass constraint was added between ligand and protein to avoid them flying away. Details of the methodology can be found in the paper.
#### Syntax
```bash
python run_MD.py <psffile> <ncrstfile> <prmfile> <temp> <outname> <rand> <sim_time>
  <psffile> The psf file for your CG protein and ligand.
  <ncrstfile> The ncrst file obtained from the end of the co-translational simulation that only contains coordinates and velocities of protein and ligand.
  <prmfile> The OpenMM xml file of your force field.
  <temp> Temperature in Kelvin for the simulation.
  <outname> The prefix for the output file name.
  <rand> Random seed.
  <sim_time> Total simulation time in seconds.
```
